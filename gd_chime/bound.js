// A primitive given one reads it as it draws, and IS DRAWN AGAIN WHEN
// ANYTHING IT READ MOVES: every model value read on the way notes its bell
// (reads.js), and the reader listens to exactly those. Nobody lists what to
// listen to. A model's value is one itself (value.js); a value worked out
// from others is a function (ui.bound), and reads whatever the function
// read, however it came to read it.
//
// map(format) is for presentation formatting only: the value passed through
// a function on the way, on whatever the value read. A handle, the item an
// each hands its template, is a bound value too, and field(key) reads one
// key of the item it holds. A template must read through the handle, not
// from it: while the template function itself runs, a read of the handle is
// the item's value being copied into a description, which would go stale
// with nobody told, and is reported.
